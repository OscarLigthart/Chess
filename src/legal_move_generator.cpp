// --> IN THIS CLASS    
// given a player, all the legal moves should be calculated

// --> IN THE PIECE CLASSES
// to do so, we will need to get all possible moves from the pieces themselves, 
// these will have to be sorted based on closest to farthest move

// How to split the board and legalmovegenerator?

// What to do with captures?
